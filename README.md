AppDF
=====

Application description file for the appstores. The goal is to develop a specification that will simplify application uploading process to the Android application stores.

Specification

Current specification draft can be found here:  
https://github.com/onepf/AppDF/blob/master/specification/appds_spec_1_0.md

Samples
=====
You can download three AppDF samples:  
* [MX Player](https://github.com/onepf/AppDF/raw/master/samples/MX%20Player/mxplayer.appdf) - a free video player localized to three languages
* [SPB Swedish Cards](https://github.com/onepf/AppDF/raw/master/samples/SPB%20Swedish%20Cards/spbswedishcards.appdf) - a paid application localized to many languages
* [Yandex.Shell](https://github.com/onepf/AppDF/raw/master/samples/Yandex.Shell/yandex.shell.appdf) - a free application limited to several countries

AppDF Editor (Preview)
